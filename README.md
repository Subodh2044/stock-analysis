## Overview

Steve wants to make see an analysis to convince his parents to make an investment is green energy stocks. He wants to explore various green enerygy stocks and choose the company that will provide the best return for his parents.

The purpose of this analysis is to show the volume of the stocks traded for each of the companies to find out how actively stocks traded in the market which will help to determine value of the stocks by looking at the trend of the stock prices to make a sound investment decision.

I decided to analyze all the stocks to see how actively they are traded in the market and find out return of each individual stocks for both of the years - 2017 and 2018. To make it easier for Steve to look at the information of volume of the stocks and the return, I created a button which will ask the year Steve want to see the analysis on and will give the result with few seconds.
